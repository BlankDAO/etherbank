Ether Bank is a decentralized bank on Ethereum. It gives out zero-interest loans for Ether holders. The loans allow Ether holders to deal with their expenses without selling their ETH.

### Ether Bank as a Lending Platform
Current decentralized loan solutions like SALT, Nexo, or MakerDAO require 2.5% to 22% interest, stability fee, liquidation penalty, etc. Ether Bank however, does not require any kind of interest, fee, or penalty whatsoever. Thereâ€™s also no due time for paying back the loans in Ether Bank as long as enough collateral has been locked as collateral.

### Ether Dollar as a Stablecoin
The loans in Ether Bank are paid in Ether dollars which are crypto-collateralized stablecoins. The main advantages of Ether dollar as compared to other crypto-collateralized stablecoins are presented in the following table:



|              | Other Crypto-collateralized Stablecoins                    | Ether dollar                         |
| ------------ | ------------                                               | ------------                         |
| Stability    | Lose value by US dollar inflations                         | Maintains a fixed value              |
| Cost         | Have token based governance                                | Has an immutable smart contract      |
|              | Have stability fee and liquidation penalty, etc.           | Has no fees and penalties whatsoever |
| Simplicity   | Have thousands of code lines                               | Has hundreds of code lines           |
|              | Have extra tokens besides the collateral and stable tokens | Has no extra tokens                  |
| Reliability  | Have High default risk                                     | Has low default risk                 |
|              | Require higher fee and interest in high demands to benefit the investors | Requires higher collateral in high demands to  secure the system |

### Ether Dollar Benefits People
* Ether dollar makes it possible for people to store value in decentralized money that: 
   ** Unlike current fiat money has zero inflation.
   ** Unlike current crypto-assets has no price fall risk in bear market.

### Ether Dollar Benefits ETH HODLers
* Ether dollar makes it possible for ETH hodlers to receive zero interest loans with no due time in order to deal with their expenses without spending the crypto-assets they own.
Moreover, using ETH to back loans not only increases the demand for but also decreases the supply of ETH and eventually results into a significant boost in price.
